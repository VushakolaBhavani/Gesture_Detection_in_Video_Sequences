# Gesture_Detection_in_Video_Sequences
The purpose of this script is to detect a specific gesture within a video sequence. It accomplishes this by comparing the gesture representation (an image or a short video clip) with each frame of the test video. If the gesture is detected in a frame, the script overlays the word "DETECTED" in bright green on the top right corner of the frame.
